# About this Certificate

The Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate contains 8 courses (over 180 hours of instruction and hundreds of practice-based assessments) and anyone can enroll on Coursera. To learn more, click [here](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics#about).

This repository will be used to hold my capstone projects from the final course of the certificate. I will be following the steps of the data analysis process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, act) I learned throughout the courses, and the case study roadmap provided as a guide.
